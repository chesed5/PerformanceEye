	PURPOSE: Collects data from a wide array of session-focused DMVs and stores the data in various AutoWho tables.
		Much care has gone into finding the right balance of completeness and efficiency, and much of the below
		4800+ lines of code are crafted in a specific fashion to reduce the impact to the SQL instance. 
		The AutoWho.Options table includes meanings for most of the parameters to this procedure, and inline comments
		below will explain many other aspects of this procedure's logic.

		See the "Control Flow Summary" comment below.


	FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS: 
 		- What if we used the OUTPUT into tabvar approach with the initial SPID capture query? We could save off fields like session_id, blocking_session_id, duration, 
			and other stuff that would be useful for the scope queries and other stuff. This output tabvar would be much smaller to scan than the #sar table (since
			#sar has so many fields), reducing the # of page reads for later statements.

		- If there are Lazy Writer, CHECKPOINT, or Backup spids active, we could go to the Perfmon DMV and pull info there to get throughput numbers

		- We could implement a DimDatabase table so that we could track what the DBName was for a given database_id value over time. Right now,
			it is possible for the dbid that is stored to refer to a different DBName (via detach/attach), or to refer to a database that has 
			since been detached but never re-attached) and thus resolves to NULL.

		--Eventually optimize the Batch/Stmt query plan logic so that if we get query plans for batch, use that base data to 
		-- get statement-level query plans from what we've already pulled, like what we do for the SQL batch/statement logic if
		-- both are enabled.

/* Control Flow Summary

	1. Variable declaration & initialization

	2. Temp table declaration

	3. Initial population of the #sessions_and_requests (aka "#sar") table. This joins all of the main
		session/request-focused DMVs together and grabs the relevant columns/rows

	4. Initial population of the #tasks_and_waits (aka "#taw") table. This joins dm_os_tasks & dm_os_waiting_tasks
		and grabs the relevant columns/rows

	(the 3 scoping queries are where calc__return_to_user is set)
	5. Main scoping query: applies filter table, maps blocker/blockee info.

	6. Scoping query #2: pulls back in sessions that were excluded by filtering but are blocking sessions that were not filtered.

	7. Scoping query #3: pulls back in sessions that were excluded by the initial #sar population statement b/c they were not
		running, did not have an open tran, were not an interesting system session, and were not using a "large" amount of TempDB,
		but ARE blocking a session that did qualify for the initial #sar population. 
	
	8. Scan the #sar table, populating a number of "threshold variables" that help drive which auxiliary captures we enter.

	9. Scan the #taw table, populating a few more "threshold variables"

	10. If THREADPOOL waits were found in the #taw "threshold variable" scan, insert a "dummy spid" into #sar that will
		represent those threadpool waits.

	11. If there was a blocked SPID that had been blocked for @thresh__maxWaitLength_BlockedSPID milliseconds, 
		enter the Blocking Tree logic, which recursively builds blocking chains.

	12. If we need to capture Input Buffers (need depends on several different things), we enter the IB logic that
		loops over every SPID whose IB needs to be captured, and we run DBCC INPUTBUFFER.

	13. If we need to capture transaction info, populate the AutoWho.TransactionDetails table with info from
		the dm_tran_* views

	14. For user spids with calc__return_to_user > 0, we join the #sar table to the SQL statement store (CorePE.SQLStmtStore)
		and grab the PK IDs. This is basically "capturing" the sql text (and potentially batch text) for SPIDs who
		are reusing a sql_handle/statement_start_offset/statement_end_offset that has already been placed into
		CorePE.SQLStmtStore before. This can potentially avoid the cost of resolving lots of sql_handle/offset combos
		through dm_exec_sql_text.

	15. For #sar records that we need to resolve batch & stmt text for, but #14 did not fulfill, loop over the
		sql_handle/offset combos and call dm_exec_sql_text

	16. If our threshold scan found SPIDs that need their query plan obtained, enter the query plan statement logic 
		and grab query plans with dm_exec_text_query_plan.

	17. If our threshold scan found SPIDs whose lock info needs to be captured and aggregated, enter the logic
		for grabbing dm_tran_locks info.

	18. If the Collector has been directed to resolve page latches, enter the logic to pull all page latch waits
		(the resource_description column) and use DBCC PAGE to obtain object and index IDs.

	19. If we entered the BChain logic earlier, and actually generated BChain data, insert a dummy row that
		the BChain data will be tied to.

	20. Dimension logic: 
			Our threshold scan also checked for Dimension IDs that were null in #sar & #taw... that is, where
			the joins to the dimension tables didn't find a match. This means we need to insert a new dimension member.

			For each dimension table, we check to see if @NewDims__<dim table> is > 0, and if so, we grab the new member
			and insert it.

			Once this check (and any necessary new member insertion) has been done for all Dims, we check all Dims 
			together and if any had an insertion, we construct dynamic SQL and update the #sar table with the new
			dimension keys that were just inserted.

			Finally, if there are STILL null dims in the #sar table, we save those rows off to the SARException table
			for diagnosis later.

	21. If we pulled (into temp tables) SQL text, Input Buffers, or Query Plans, we then update the permanent store 
			tables with the stuff we pulled into temp tables.

	22. We then persist the #sar data to AutoWho.SessionsAndRequests, joining in the qp and ib tables as needed.

	23. We persist the #taw data to AutoWho.TasksAndWaits, persisting background tasks (null session_id) if they
		have certain interesting wait types (practically speaking, THREADPOOL is the main one here). We persist
		all tasks for parallel queries only if the request's duration is above a certain threshold.

	24. Persist the BlockingGraph data, if we gathered any.

	25. Done!

		-- In order to efficiently determine whether any of those scenarios exist, we do a one-time scan of #sar, and another scan of #taw,
		-- and store whether these states exist.

		--NOTE: some spids are to be excluded from threshold consideration (see the "istfx" calculation further down below) UNLESS they are block-relevant. A good
		--	example of this is a monitoring spid that sits in a loop all day and every X seconds wakes up and does work. 
		--NOTE2: the following threshold calculations only reflect spids that have calc__return_to_user > 0. i.e. spids that are not going to be returned
		-- (e.g. because their context is a DB that has been excluded) do not influence the value of these threshold variables.

		--calculated from #SAR table
		@thresh__OpenTransExist							TINYINT,	-- if "istfx=0", holds a 1 if any sess__open_transaction_count values are 1, or if the session or request 
																	--  tran iso levels are 0 (unspecified), 3 (RR), or 4 (serializable)
																	--	EFFECT: if 1, causes the auxiliary capture on the Tran DMVs to be fired, even if there are no active or IdleWithTran
																	--		spids that have a duration > the @TranDetailsThreshold.

		@thresh__maxActiveDuration						BIGINT,		--> (For USER spids only) the maximum duration of any running batch.
																	--  EFFECT: (1) If the max active duration is >= the @InputBufferThreshold, causes user spids that are over this threshold
																	--		to have their InputBuffer captured. (as long as calc__return_to_user > 0, of course)
																	--		(2) If max active duration is >= the @TranDetailsThreshold, triggers entry into the Tran Details aux capture,
																	--			where every calc__return_to_user spid with either sess__open_transaction_count or a duration >= @TranDetailsThreshold
																	--			to have their trans captured from the tran DMVs

		@thresh__maxIdleWOTranDuration					BIGINT,		--	(USER spids only) the max "time since last batch" (last_request_end_time) of any spids that do NOT have a tran open
																	--  EFFECT: if this value is >= the @InputBufferThreshold, causes user spids that are over this threshold
																	--		to have their InputBuffer captured. (as long as calc__return_to_user > 0, of course)

		@thresh__maxIdleWithTranDuration				BIGINT,		--  (USER spids only) same as above, except for idle spids that DO have a tran open
																	--  EFFECT: (1) if this value is >= the @InputBufferThreshold, causes user spids that are over this threshold
																	--		to have their InputBuffer captured. (as long as calc__return_to_user > 0, of course)
																	--		(2) If max Idle With Tran duration is >= the @TranDetailsThreshold, triggers entry into the Tran Details aux capture,
																	--			where every calc__return_to_user spid with either sess__open_transaction_count or a duration >= @TranDetailsThreshold
																	--			to have their trans captured from the tran DMVs

		@thresh__QueryPlansNeeded						TINYINT,	-- we check for spids that need their query plan obtained. If even one spid has the following criteria, we set this to 1:
																	--		it is block-relevant, and its running duration is >= @QueryPlanThresholdBlockRel
																	--		it is NOT block-relevant, and its running duration is >= @QueryPlanThreshold
																	--		it is a threshold-ignore spid (and not block-relevant) and it is NOT waiting with the WAITFOR type

		@thresh__GhostCleanupIsRunning					TINYINT,	-- I've seen some terrible runtimes for DBCC PAGE when GHOST CLEANUP is running. To work around this, we check
																	--  for whether Ghost Cleanup is running by pre-defining the DimCommand value (=2) and then checking for its existence
																	--  in SAR. If we do see a spid running this command, then we know to avoid any page latch resolution logic.

		--calculated from #TAW table
		@thresh__THREADPOOLpresent						INT,		--  whether there are any THREADPOOL waits currently. If so, a "special spid" with session_id -998 will be created
																	--  and these waits will be tied to that "spid".

		@thresh__PAGELATCHpresent						INT,		-- whether there are any PAGELATCH or PAGEIOLATCH waits currently. If so, and @ResolvePageLatches = N'Y', then
																	-- logic will be run to resolve the latch resource_description values into the objectid/indexid values

		@thresh__maxWaitLength_BlockedSPID				BIGINT,		-- (For both USER and system spids) the longest wait_duration where blocking_session_id is not null (and <> self)
																	-- This value is used in determining whether to execute Bchain logic and to obtain Lock Details
																	--  EFFECT: (1) If the max wait length of any blocked spid (regardless of whether wait is lock, memory, pagelatch, or other)
																	--		is >= @BlockingChainThreshold, then the BChain logic is triggered.
																	--		(2) If the max wait length of any blocked spid is >= the @ObtainLocksForBlockRelevantThreshold value, then the
																	--		aux capture for Lock Details is triggered

		--calculated from #sar, except for @NewDims__WaitType_taw. Note that the "istfx" calculation is not relevant for these.

	-- The below CREATE defines the central table for this procedure. Several notes are in order:
	--  1. Each column name has a prefix tag, then 2 underscores, and then the column name that corresponds to the DMV column from where it was taken.
	--		Thus, the "start_time" column from the sys.dm_exec_requests DMV is named "rqst__start_time".

	--  2. Fields that are not directly copied from DMVs, but instead hold a result of logic in this proc, begin with "calc__"

		/* We use RIGHT OUTER JOIN and join hints to force the plan shape that we want. We want to ensure that the optimizer 
			pulls from the Dim tables first before it grabs anything from the DMVs. This assists in creating the illusion of 
			a true "point-in-time" snapshot of the DMVs (impossible to actually get in a changing system), since the dynamic
			content is accessed "closer together" in the query plan.

			The order that the DMVs are accessed roughly corresponds to how volatile they are. That is, we access DMVs that
			are highly volatile first, since more stable DMVs are likely to have the same contents for the extra few dozen
			milliseconds that it will take to get there in the query plan.

			Thus, through the use of ROJ, join hints, and placement, we get a query plan where the most volatile DMVs
			are captured to their hash bucket quickly, and the less volatile DMVs are captured to their hash bucket later,
			"towards the far lower right" of the query plan.
			
			Note also the use of AutoWho.CollectorOptFakeout. It is a simple 2 row table (values of 0 and 1) whose sole purpose
			is to allow us to NOT have a DMV in the very lowest-rightest position. If we had a DMV in that position, rows would 
			stream up to the upper-left from that DMV, but one at a time. That would increase the latency between the first GetRow()
			call to that DMV and the last, decreasing our illusion of a "point in time" snapshot of the system. Therefore, we
			use AutoWho.CollectorOptFakeout in that position instead, so that sys.dm_exec_sessions is pulled into a hash table
			all at once.

/*
There are a number of points worth noting re: the below scoping queries:

	1) The weird way of joining these tables below is intentional: 
		the Right Outer Joins allow us to force a hash match, with the hash tables being built on the much smaller derived tables (the 2 
		references to #TaskSnapshot). This gives us a "Data Warehouse-style plan shape, where the 
		the choice to put the "ON s.sess__session_id = ListOfBlockers.blocker_session_id" clause (to finish the join criteria between the
		#SpidMon_Sessions table and the ListOfBlockers derived table) at the very end of the FROM section is also intentional. The alternative
		would be to put the join between #SpidMon_sessions and one of the derived tables into a derived table, something like:

		UPDATE #SpidMon_Sessions
		FROM 
			( #TaskSnapshot) ListOfBLockers
				RIGHT OUTER JOIN 
				(
					(#TaskSnapshot) blockedRequests
						RIGHT OUTER JOIN
							#SpidMon_sessions
								ON blah blah
				) myDerivedTable
					ON blah blah

		The problem with this approach is that the "UPDATE" portion of the statement can't "see" the #SpidMon_sessions table reference. 
		It's "line of sight" to that reference has been blocked, as it were. Thus, we would have to join in #SpidMon_Sessions AGAIN 
		in order for the UPDATE portion to be able to "see" the table that it is updating. This means a second reference to #SpidMon_Sessions,
		and thus an extra join, and thus a slower query.

	2) We let the Waiting Tasks snapshot drive which spids are actually blocked rather than the dm_exec_requests DMV,
		since this is more accurate for parallel queries. Note that since the below statement assigns blocking spid information 
		without taking into account whether the blocked task is actually the task that has been waiting the longest, we could 
		assign a "blocked" status to a spid that has actually been waiting longer on something else. For example, a parallel query 
		could have 1 task that has been waiting on a PAGEIOLATCH type for 230 ms (a really slow disk IO), and have 
		another task that has been waiting only 80 ms for a lock that another SPID has. In these scenarios, we report 
		the spid as blocked even though the worst wait is actually not a blocking scenario. This will typically not 
		be a problem b/c most blocking scenarios will either resolve themselves quickly (when the app is programmed decently) 
		or will quickly become the longest wait for any task in a parallel query.

	--		2. An active batch is blocked by a spid that has been excluded due to filtering or exclusion rules. For example, this 
	--			could happen if the blocker was executing in a context of a DB that is in the @FilterTable tabvar, or if the

--The order chosen for the following steps is intentional:
-- 1. If desired (parameter) and appropriate (threshold), construct the BChains. This lets us know whether we need to get input buffers even if the user didn't specify to get input buffers.
-- 2. Go and get input buffers if necessary, whether because user asked for them, BChains require them, or both
-- 3. Do other stuff.
-- The reason we prioritize input buffer code over, say, the statement & batch loops is because those are more likely to stick around for a few 
-- seconds, due to the way the procedure/plan cache works. However, a short-lived spid (or one that is quickly reset via connection pooling) will
-- not give us an input buffer (or the right input buffer) if we wait too long, so we want to grab that information as soon as we can.
